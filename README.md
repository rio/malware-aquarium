# Malware-Aquarium

> Looking for the research paper? You can find it [here](Malware_Aquarium-By_Raresh_Bratean_and_Rio_Kierkels-2022-12-23.pdf)!

## Description

A malware aquarium is a bounded space for malware to live its life, possibly indefinitely, without escaping its boundaries, while the environment still allows its observation. Translating this into computer systems, in the context of this research, the malware aquarium is a fully reachable network with interconnected machines that have extensible and controllable visibility paths. From the malware's perspective, it is living in an actual network with multiple machines allowing it to propagate and possibly coexist with other malware strains within the same systems.

This project implements a proof of concept from this idea by integrating multiple requirements from sandbox technologies and secure architecture accompanied by an analysis of Trojans and Worms TTPs. The project itself is still in its early development ,however, it was tested with two malware, TrickBot and HermeticWizard. The results from those deployments were compared with two reports of free online sandboxes, Joe Sandbox  and Triage. In both cases the malware aquarium revelived more insightful details or the entire infection process.


## Disclaimer

The following terms apply to this project:

- The project was created with the purpose of analysing malware, however, we do not guarantee the safety of the system for every malware.
- The isolation around the malware aquarium is the responsibility of the user, who assumes the risk of using it as well.
- Any misuse of this system is not the responsibility of the contributors.
- For any use of this project recognition and attribution of the creators (Rio Kierkels & Rares Bratean) has to be made.
- We disagree and disallow the usage of this project for financial or commercial purposes. Therefore, any integration and development of these tools should be open to the public.
- We are not responsible if a user breaches any licensing within the open source or free tools within this version of the project.
- We allow modification, development, close and open source utilization of this project.

## Note

This project still requires clean up and a tutorial of how to install/use the malware aquarium. Hence, it is not at its final version yet. We will update this project as soon as possible.
