# Malware-Aquarium

## Description

A malware aquarium is a bounded space for malware to live its life, possibly indefinitely, without escaping its boundaries, while the environment still allows its observation. Translating this into computer systems, in the context of this research, the malware aquarium is a fully reachable network with interconnected machines that have extensible and controllable visibility paths. From the malware's perspective, it is living in an actual network with multiple machines allowing it to propagate and possibly coexist with other malware strains within the same systems.

This project implements a proof of concept from this idea by integrating multiple requirements from sandbox technologies and secure architecture accompanied by an analysis of Trojans and Worms TTPs. The project itself is still in its early development ,however, it was tested with two malware, TrickBot and HermeticWizard. The results from those deployments were compared with two reports of free online sandboxes, Joe Sandbox  and Triage. In both cases the malware aquarium revelived more insightful details or the entire infection process.


## Disclaimer

The project was created with the purpose of analysing malware, however, we do not guarantee the safety of the system for every malware. The isolation around the malware aquarium is the responsibility and risk of the user. Moreover, any misuse of this system is not our responsibility.

## Note

This project still requires clean up as it is not at its final version yet.
